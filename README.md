# Mobile robotics mapping using deep reinforcement learning

This repository was created to developing the final paper project for the course of Mechatronic Engineering 

The DDPG model was inpired in cyoon1729.github.io tutorial: https://towardsdatascience.com/deep-deterministic-policy-gradients-explained-2d94655a9b7b
